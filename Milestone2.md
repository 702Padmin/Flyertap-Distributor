# Milestone 2
Now that the Mobile app is complete. We want to start pulling data saved on the database onto the Web Application in an Administrator UI so we can view and manage all the users and their runs.
As of right now, the Web Application is just a Laravel template of a CRM. This can be viewed [here](https://adm.flyertap.com/login)

We have set up the pages that will be needed.



# Deliverables
Complete the tasks below to complete the 2nd Milestone. (Check off completed items)

The Admin Dashboard will consist of:

Dashboard Page (overview of all new users and current runs)
Users Page (Ability to View Users in a data format as well as the option to edit their information. We should also have a single user page where, we can click to view all thier info and thier runs.)
Tasks Page (Ability to view all user runs. Which will include data such as the map and path taken, date, the user making the run, a title for the run, etc. We should also have a single task page where we can click to view all of its info.)
