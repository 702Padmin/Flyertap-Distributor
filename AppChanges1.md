# Mobile App Changes

## Login/Sign Up Process

### Issues and bugs
- [ ] There is a weird white bar on the loading screen (See Video).
- [ ] When I completed a run, the screen would go white (See Video).

### Add Labels to inputs on both Login and Sign Up Forms
- [ ] Phone Number Field label needs to say "Phone Number"
- [ ] Work Amount Field Needs to be a Select Input. (Label: "What job type are you looking for?"  Options: (Full-time, Part-time, Gig Work))
- [ ] Start Date Field needs label: "When are you available to start work?"
- [ ] Locations Fields all need Labels: And they need to be as follows: Street Address, City, State, Zip

### Mobile App Run tracking Photo Feature
Once a user completes their run there is supposed to be a form they need to submit that is submitted into the database under that run activity,
It is one of the tasks for the [1st milestone](https://github.com/702Padmin/Flyertap-Distributor/blob/dev/Milestone1.md) called "Mobile App Run tracking Photo Feature"
- [ ] Once the user stops the timer and completes the run we want users to be prompted to fill out a form with the following questions:
- [ ] What Campaign did you complete? (Text Input Required)
- [ ] Which Zipcode did you distribute for? (Text Input Required)
- [ ] Additional Notes (textbox Required)
- [ ] A Final Picture (photo upload, required)
- [ ] Once submitted, the user will be redirected back to the home screen.

### Email Template
We want to make some changes to the email template that get sent to the user when logging into the website:
